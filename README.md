# Kodo Back End Challenge

## The Kodo Robot Daycare Centre

> The year is 2113 and robots are now an integral part of life. The Kodo Corporation are the leading company in personalised human robot interaction, but some of their robots are getting a bit....old. We have become so used to technology working perfectly that these old robots need to retire so humanity can continue to live with no interruption to their way of life.
> When this time comes, all Kodo robots must retire to the Kodo Robot DayCare Centre!
> 
> Taking care of a malfunction robot is a time-consuming task and in our busy society not every person has the time to do so. Thatâ€™s why we are building the Kodo Robot's daycare centre.

> The Kodo robot's daycare centres are subsidised by the government and in order for them to benefit from this program, they need to give government inspectors access to their database of guests.

### The inspectors API

The inspectors come to our centre and check our "robot guests" one by one and update the database.

As the inspectors are robots as well, they don't use a web browser to communicate with our system, but a very simple API that we have to implement for them.

The API has 4 methods:
 * **[Update]** update a Kodo robot's attributes
 * **[Show]** get a Kodo robot's actual attributes
 * **[Index]** get a list of all the Kodo robot's in our database
 * **[History]** get a Kodo robot's attributes changes

#### [Update] update a Kodo robot's attributes

The inspector sends the attributes for a specific Kodo robot.
Our system detects if the Kodo robot is already in our database or not. If not, we create it and if yes, we go directly to the next step.
We update the Kodo robot's attributes, only changing the ones included in the actual update request.
Example
The Kodo XX1 is already in our system and has the following attributes:

```
size: 150cm

weight: 12kg

status: good conditions

color: white

age: 107years
```

The inspector checks the Kodo robot and decides to update his attributes and sends the following information:

```
color: dirty cream white

age: 124years

number of eyes: 1

number of antenna: 3
```

The Kodo XX1 now has these attributes:

```
size: 150cm

weight: 12kg

status: good conditions

color: dirty cream white

age: 124years

number of eyes: 1

number of antennas: 3
```

Be aware that the attributes are not predefined and can be anything on both sides: key and value.

#### [Show] get a Kodo robot's actual attributes

The inspector wants to know about the actual attributes of a Kodo robot

Example

The inspector asks for the Kodo XX1 and the system responses with the following information:

```
size: 150cm

weight: 12kg

status: good conditions

color: dirty cream white

age: 124years

number of eyes: 1

number of antennas: 3
```

#### [Index] get a list of all the Kodo robot's in our database

The inspector wants to have an overview of all the Kodo robot's in our database.

Example
The inspector makes the call and the system responses with the following information:

```
1

name: XX1

last_update: 2113-12-01

2

name: XX2

last_update: 2113-12-03

3

name: XX3

last_update: 2113-12-12
```

#### [History] get a Kodo robot's attributes changes

The inspector is interested in knowing about the evolution of the Kodo robot, so he asks for the changes on the attributes that have been done for this specific robot.

Example:
The inspector asks for the history of the Kodo XX1, the system responses with the following information:

```
2112-11-28 10:23:24

type: create

changes:

size: [] -> [150cm]

weight: [] -> [12kg]

status: [] -> [good conditions]

color: [] -> [white]

age: [] -> [107years]

2113-12-02 16:30:11

type: update

changes:

color: [white] -> [dirty cream white]

age: [123years] -> [124years]

number of eyes: [] -> [1]

number of antennas: [] -> [3]
```
